# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of
experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance,
race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Any conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
	professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or
harmful.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the project team at [hello@mokoconsulting.tech]

investigated promptly and fairly.
