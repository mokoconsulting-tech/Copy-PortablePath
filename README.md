# Copy-PortablePath - README.md

**Copy-PortablePath** is a lightweight Windows enhancement that adds **‚ÄúCopy Relative Path‚Äù** and **‚ÄúCopy Absolute Path‚Äù** options to the right-click (context) menu in File Explorer. It is designed for developers, IT staff, and anyone who needs quick, consistent path copying in a **portable-friendly format** (using `/` instead of `\`).

---

## üìã Features

* **Two copy modes**:

  * **Copy Relative Path** ‚Äì Path relative to the script‚Äôs working directory.
  * **Copy Absolute Path** ‚Äì Full absolute path to the file or folder.
* **Portable path format** (`/` separators) for cross-platform compatibility.
* **No dependencies** ‚Äî works out of the box with PowerShell.
* **Error handling** ‚Äî detects and reports missing files, registry issues, and permission errors.
* **Installation check** ‚Äî verifies if context menu entries are already installed before making changes.

## üöÄ Installation

1. **Download** this repository or copy the required scripts to a local folder, for example:

   ```
   C:/Copy-PortablePath/
   ```
2. **Run the installer script** in PowerShell **as Administrator**:

   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
   C:/Copy-PortablePath/install.ps1
   ```
3. The script will:

   * Check if context menu entries are already installed.
   * Display a message and exit if already installed.
   * Apply the registry changes if not installed.
   * Report any errors encountered during the process.
4. **Restart File Explorer** (or log out and back in) to apply the new context menu entries.

---

## üñ± Usage

1. **Right-click** a file or folder in File Explorer.
2. Select:

   * **Copy Relative Path** ‚Äì Path relative to the script‚Äôs working directory.
   * **Copy Absolute Path** ‚Äì Full path with `/` separators.
3. Paste into your application, code editor, or terminal.

---

## ‚öô Customization

* **Relative path base** ‚Äì Edit `$BasePath` in `Copy-PortablePath.ps1` to control how relative paths are calculated.
* **Separator style** ‚Äì Default is `/` for cross-platform use. Change:

  ```powershell
  $PortablePath = $Path -replace '\\','/'
  ```

  to:

  ```powershell
  $PortablePath = $Path
  ```

  to keep Windows `\`.
* **Default mode bypass** ‚Äì Run the script directly:

  ```powershell
  C:/Copy-PortablePath/Copy-PortablePath.ps1 -Mode Absolute
  C:/Copy-PortablePath/Copy-PortablePath.ps1 -Mode Relative
  ```

---

## üîÑ Uninstallation

Run:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
C:/Copy-PortablePath/uninstall.ps1
```

The uninstall script includes checks to confirm:

* If the registry entries exist before attempting removal.
* If removal was successful, with error reporting if not.
