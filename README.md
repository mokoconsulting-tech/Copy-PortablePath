# Copy-PortablePath - README.md

**Copy-PortablePath** is a lightweight Windows enhancement that adds **‚ÄúCopy Relative Path‚Äù** and **‚ÄúCopy Absolute Path‚Äù** options to the right-click (context) menu in File Explorer.
It is designed for developers, IT staff, and anyone who needs quick, consistent path copying in a **portable-friendly format** (using `/` instead of `\\`).

---

## üìã Features

* **Two copy modes**:

  * **Copy Relative Path** ‚Äì Path relative to the script‚Äôs working directory.
  * **Copy Absolute Path** ‚Äì Full absolute path to the file or folder.
* **Portable path format** (`/` separators) for cross-platform compatibility.
* **No dependencies** ‚Äî works out of the box with PowerShell.
* **Install & uninstall scripts** for quick setup.

## ‚öô Customization

* **Relative path base**
  Edit `$BasePath` in `Copy-PortablePath.ps1` to control how relative paths are calculated.

* **Separator style**
  Default: `/` for cross-platform use.
  Change:

  ```powershell
  $PortablePath = $Path -replace '\\\\','/'
  ```

  to:

  ```powershell
  $PortablePath = $Path
  ```

  to keep Windows `\\`.

* **Default mode bypass**
  Run the script directly with:

  ```powershell
  .\\Copy-PortablePath.ps1 -Mode Absolute
  ```

  or:

  ```powershell
  .\\Copy-PortablePath.ps1 -Mode Relative
  ```
