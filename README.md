Copy-PortablePath - README.md

Copy-PortablePath is a lightweight Windows enhancement that adds ‚ÄúCopy Relative Path‚Äù and ‚ÄúCopy Absolute Path‚Äù options to the right-click (context) menu in File Explorer.

üìã Features

Two copy modes:

Portable path format (/ separators) for cross-platform compatibility.

No dependencies ‚Äî works out of the box with PowerShell.

Error handling ‚Äî detects and reports missing files, registry issues, and permission errors.

Installation check ‚Äî verifies if context menu entries are already installed before making changes.

Installer can be run from right-click ‚Äî Simply right-click install.ps1 and select Run with PowerShell to install without opening a terminal.

üì¶ Prerequisites
